## üìó About this Application
----
*A healthy diet helps to protect against malnutrition in all its forms, as well as non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. An unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity are leading global risks to health. Nowadays, people are consuming foods with high fat, calories, sodium and many of them do not have enough fruits, vegetables, and other dietary fiber such as whole-grain* - World Health Organization(WHO)

>The food you eat can be either the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of Poison. - Ann Wigmore

This application is implemented in React Native (build with expo and Redux). It is designed for both iOS and Android as it is cross-platform application. Apart from this high fidelity mockups are designed in AdobeXD.

## üèó Introduction
----
## Why?
The key objective of this application is to raise awareness about how many calories and nutrients are contained by dish. So that one can maintain a healthy diet while simultaneously satisfying cravings for tasty foods. People who cook for themselves may be perplexed sometimes as to how to prepare something different. At some stage, you may become bored with the same old recipes and flavors. So that people can search by item name and get a list of possibilities with nutritional information and the entire recipe for that dish.
Apart from this, best way to learn any concept is to implement it in real life. So, to use my basic practical knowledge about React-native from academics, I have decided to implement this project. This project is also a part of my curriculum.

## Intended Audience
This application is for anyone who is worried about their health and diet in their everyday lives. Also, for individuals who are weary of the same old recipes and flavours and want to try something new while maintaining their health, this app allows them to search among over 2 million dishes, which is a significant quantity.
